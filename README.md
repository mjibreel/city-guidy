In 2019, I embarked on developing an Android application designed to make navigation and city guiding in Somalia more accessible and efficient. The goal was to provide users with an intuitive interface that offered real-time GPS-based directions, highlighting landmarks and essential locations such as hospitals, markets, and government offices. However, during the development and testing phase, I encountered a significant challengeâ€”GPS services in Somalia were either non-functional or unreliable due to infrastructure limitations.

Despite this, the project was a valuable learning experience. It enhanced my understanding of mobile app development, user interface design, and the importance of factoring in external dependencies such as local technological infrastructure. While the project was ultimately paused, it fueled my passion for creating innovative solutions and highlighted the importance of adaptability when working on location-based applications.
